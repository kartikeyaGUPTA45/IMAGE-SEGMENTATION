# IMAGE-SEGMENTATION

Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments (sets of pixels, also known as image objects). The goal of segmentation is to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze.

# APPLICATIONS
1-Object Detection 
2-Face Recognition
3-Traffic Control Systems
